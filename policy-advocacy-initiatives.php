The key mandate of NTT is to focus on the policy issues pertaining to micro finance sector and to communicate as a collective group with the various institutions/stakeholders involved in policy making at national level such as Reserve Bank of India, Govt. of India, IRDA, PFRDA etc. The NTT also provides policy and strategic guidance to other initiatives under the programme from time to time. 8 meetings of the Think Tank have been held so far.</th>

A policy paper “The Microfinance Bill: Need for a Fresh Outlook” authored by Dr. Alok Misra was released for comments by ACCESS ASSIST and UNDP in the Inclusive Finance India Summit in December 2014. A roundtable under PSIG was organised, to deliberate on the consensus on the outlook for microfinance regulation. The panel at the roundtable comprised of a mix of players, including representation from MFIN, M-CRIL, NBFC-MFIs, NGO-MFIs, investors, IBA, and sector experts. A total of 26 paticipants contributed in the roundtable. The members debated on the need for MFI Bill considering the changed policy landscape, the time and effort required for another round of legislative procedures and the suitable agency to champion the fresh impetus for a new bill, the majority, including the NBFC-MFIs supported the need for regulation covering all forms of microfinance, through the means of a bill. It was concluded that an omnibus regulation is required covering all forms of MFIs and regulatory approach should not be restricted to the legal type but by the type of the underlying activity/business. In the current policy landscape, NGO-MFIs are not the ideal legal entities to undertake financial intermediation, there has to be a supportive framework to enable them to transform within a defined time frame. Moreover, it is equally important to have robust client protection principles for other players like SBLP and Banks catering to the same client segment and clear policy/legal protection against state government intervention.</td>

Realizing the need and importance of it, PSIG-SIDBI in collaborations with other key stakeholders including Banks, RRBs, Credit Bureau agencies etc. is planning to undertake a pilot initiative to systematically capture the SHG data including-both of the groups and individual members and share that with any established credit bureau system for generating appropriate credit based information and make that available to institutional lenders for reference. The outcome of the pilot initiatives will be shared with all the key stakeholders. With a view to have a wider and collective consultation, PSIG organized a thematic workshop on “Credit Bureau System for SHG Data Reporting”. The event was participated by Banks, Microfinance Institutions, SHG promoting institutions, Business Correspondents (BCs) and BC Network Managers (BCNMs), Credit Bureau, Technical agencies, UNDP, DFID, Government of Odisha (GoO) representatives and other organisations. The key objectives of the Roundtable were to; Share the experiences and lessons learnt from microfinance credit data reporting by MFIs, facilitate deliberations on the feasibility & challenges of capturing/reporting SHG data by credit bureau and solicit suggestions for way forward to integrate or create a Credit Bureau system for the SHG channel.</td>
